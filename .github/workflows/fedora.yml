# Build re and baresip almost the same way like they would be built in Fedora. This helps to avoid
# e.g. rpath issues, requires however the usage of rpmbuild(1) to use the same compiler flags and
# options like Fedora does. Just running 'RPM_BUILD_ROOT=<top-dir> /usr/lib/rpm/check-rpaths' on
# own builds without the Fedora-specific options effectively leads to garbage results. See also:
